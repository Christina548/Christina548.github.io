The Nelson Small Business Collective is a group of small business owners in Nelson, NZ.  They currently use a Instagram page for their group activties and discussions.  As part of WEB502 FrameWork Customisation I am designing a new website for the group.  The website was first designed in WordPress and then it will be developed in Strapi.
